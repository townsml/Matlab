# Mech105 algorithms
This archive has the functions that where writen for the MECH 105 class at Colorodo State University for Fall 2018.
The algorthims are
1. Heun's method
* Heun's method is a way to improve the estimation of points using interations of Euler's formula. It is used to determine the next y value of a differectial equation.
2. Simpson's method
* Simpson's method is used to calculate the integral of a function numaricaly.  
3. LU Factorization with Inverse calculater
* The *L* and the *U* matrices are useful when calculating the different things for the matrix. This also calculates the inverse matrix of the matrix that is entered.
4. False Position Algorithm
* This algorithm finds the roots of a function. This is a bracketting technique.
